# baseball_steals
Based on a mark rober video about baseball steals. Wanted to try it out.

# TODO:

## Required: 
1. Iterate over each list to see the duplicate that caused the steal
2. Make it display the steal sign
3. Allow the player to loop and redo the program

## Quality of life:
1. Redo variable naming conventions
2. Add comments explaining code
3. Add support to save files to json

## Future:
1. Add gui support with kivy. 
2. Allow more than 52 characters (Without them being misc characters)
