# baseball_steals
Based on a mark rober video about baseball steals. Wanted to try it out.

(Sorry if I commit a lot lol, my first real github repo and wanna use git a lot)

TODO:
Make input for the signs used,
Iterate and seperate the pairs into lists with tuples,
Iterate over each list to see the duplicate that caused the steal
