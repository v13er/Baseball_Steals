# baseball_steals
Based on a mark rober video about baseball steals. Wanted to try it out.

# TODO:
Required: 
Iterate over each list to see the duplicate that caused the steal

Quality of life:
Redo variable naming conventions
Add comments explaining code

Future:
Add gui support with kivy. 
Allow more than 52 characters (Without them being misc characters)
